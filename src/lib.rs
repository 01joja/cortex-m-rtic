//! Real Time For the Masses (RTFM), a framework for building concurrent
//! applications, for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers
//!
//! This crate is based on [the RTFM framework] created by the Embedded Systems
//! group at [Lule√• University of Technology][ltu], led by Prof. Per Lindgren,
//! and uses a simplified version of the Stack Resource Policy as scheduling
//! policy (check the [references] for details).
//!
//! [the RTFM framework]: http://www.rtfm-lang.org/
//! [ltu]: https://www.ltu.se/?l=en
//! [per]: https://www.ltu.se/staff/p/pln-1.11258?l=en
//! [references]: ./index.html#references
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Event triggered tasks** as the unit of concurrency.
//! - Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus, **preemptive
//!   multitasking**.
//! - **Efficient and data race free memory sharing** through fine grained *non
//!   global* critical sections.
//! - **Deadlock free execution** guaranteed at compile time.
//! - **Minimal scheduling overhead** as the scheduler has no "software
//!   component": the hardware does all the scheduling.
//! - **Highly efficient memory usage**: All the tasks share a single call stack
//!   and there's no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.
//! - **All Cortex M devices are fully supported**.
//! - This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time)
//!   analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven't yet
//!   developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)
//!
//! # Constraints
//!
//! - Tasks must run to completion. That's it, tasks can't contain endless
//!   loops. However, you can run an endless event loop in the `idle` function.
//!
//! - Task priorities must remain constant at runtime.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//!
//! - A device crate generated using [`svd2rust`] v0.11.x. The input SVD file
//!   *must* contain [`<cpu>`] information.
//! - A `start` lang time: Vanilla `main` must be supported in binary crates.
//!   You can use the [`cortex-m-rt`] crate to fulfill the requirement
//!
